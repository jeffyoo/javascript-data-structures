# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is organized in such a way that allows for searching for a specific element with an `O(log N)` runtime complexity.

That is, at each tree node, you fork off into values that are lesser than the current tree node to its left, and values that are greater than the current tree node to its right. You can take advantage of this fact by cutting down the number of possible options you must iterate through by half, every level of traversal.

# Implement a BST

Implement a binary search tree that allows for this kind of usgae:
